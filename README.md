## About the game
Tic Tac Toe also known as Xs and Os is a two player game in which a player tries to align his symbol faster than the other player, could be by aligning a row like:
```
   x | x | x
  ---+---+---
   - | - | -
  ---+---+---
   - | - | -
```
, a column: 

```
   x | - | -
  ---+---+---
   x | - | -
  ---+---+---
   x | - | -
```

or in a diagonal:
```
   x | - | -
  ---+---+---
   - | x | -
  ---+---+---
   - | - | x
  ```
  
  if the board gets full before a player wins the game, the game ends on a tie!
